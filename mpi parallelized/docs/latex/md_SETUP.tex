First download the latest stable version from \href{https://www.open-mpi.org/software/}{\texttt{ here}}. Then run the following commands in a command-\/line\+:

You can skip these 2 if you already have {\ttfamily make}, {\ttfamily gcc} and {\ttfamily g++} installed. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt update}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install make gcc g++}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gunzip -\/c openmpi-\/4.1.2.tar.gz | tar xf -\/}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd openmpi-\/4.1.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{./configure -\/-\/prefix=/usr/local}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make all install}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo ldconfig}

In order to be able to use {\ttfamily mpirun} to remotely start jobs on the Raspberry Pis we first need to be able to {\ttfamily ssh} into them from a {\ttfamily remote computer} without having to manually provide a username and password.

First we create an ssh key on the {\ttfamily remote computer}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ssh-\/keygen -\/t rsa -\/b 4096}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{Note}}\+: All of the following steps also take place on the {\ttfamily remote computer}.

Then we need to copy the {\ttfamily ssh} key we just created to every Raspberry Pi in the cluster. This can be done by running the following command for every Raspberry Pi.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ssh-\/copy-\/id -\/i path/to/rsa-\/key.pub username@remote-\/ip}
\end{DoxyCode}


Now we need to give each Raspberry Pi a hostname. To do this we need to an entry in {\ttfamily /etc/hosts} for every Raspberry Pi.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{remote-\/ip hostname}
\end{DoxyCode}


Finally we need to specify the default username {\ttfamily ssh} will use for each Raspberry Pi. This done by adding the following lines to the end of {\ttfamily $\sim$/.ssh/config} for every Raspberry Pi.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Host host}
\DoxyCodeLine{    HostName hostname}
\DoxyCodeLine{    User username  }
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{Note}}\+: This can be done in a simpler way but it may come with some unintended changes.

If you set everything up correctly you should now be able run the following commands successfully.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ssh-\/add path/to/rsa-\/key \# you can add this to your .bashrc so you don't have to keep running this on every terminal}
\DoxyCodeLine{ssh hostname \# you shouldn't be asked for a username or a password}
\DoxyCodeLine{exit}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{mpirun -\/n 1 -\/host hostname echo "Hello World!" \# you should see Hello World!}
\end{DoxyCode}
